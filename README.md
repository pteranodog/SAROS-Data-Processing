# SAROS Data Processing

This repository contains the data processing scripts for the UAH Space
Hardware Club's SAROS project.

Please put all of your data in a folder called `Data` in the root of
your local repository. The `.gitignore` file is set up to NOT copy the
massive amount of data to GitHub.
